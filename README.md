# Last.fm User Export

A simple tool that exports your [Last.fm](https://last.fm) data to csv files.

Run it simply by passing your Last.fm API key, username and one or more flags specifying which data to fetch (scrobbles, loved tracks, aritsts or tags).

```
lastfmuserexport.exe -key=<LASTFM-API-KEY> -user=<LASTFM-USERNAME> [-scrobbles] [-loved] [-artists] [-tags]
```

For (slightly) more detailed usage explanation run with `help` flag

```
lastfmuserexport.exe -help
```
